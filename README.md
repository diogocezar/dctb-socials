##What is Socials?##

This is a helper. With socials, you can include social feed in your page through JQuery Ajax method.

Thinking in flood calls to servers, i created a cache system, that stores in a xml file the last JSON recovered from social server as least N hours.

After that, the next client that connect to server, refresh the XML file with new informations.

I replaced the hashtags, links and mentions.

Also have a smile icons system, that replace the icons posted at social medias.

##Technologies##

The system was developed based at 

* PHP
* JavaScript
* Ajax
* JQuery 2.x and 
* Literal Object.

##Usage##

To user socials, just replace your socials tokens at file _config/config.php_
